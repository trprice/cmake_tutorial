==============

A Tutorial for CMake with a few more details than the official CMake Tutorial. The official tutorial can be found at the following link:

http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html


Many of the items from steps 1 - 3 have been implemented with the following changes:

1.) A build directory is being used to keep the build files separate from the source files.
2.) Although they aren't strictly necessary for this example, the output directory variables make it clear where items should go.
